Medox - Readme

Some small instructions before you start using Medox:
We had quite some trouble creating a .appx from the Medox Desktop UWP and couldn’t figure it out. That is why we provide you a .zip (Medox.UWP.zip) of our desktop application. It would be awesome if you open and compile it yourself using VisualStudio.

This folder contains a .ipa file to install Medox Mobile (filename is myMD.iOS) on iOS (using Xcode) and a .apk to install Medox Mobile on Android. Additionally, we added the video of our presentation and the slides used in this video, because the ImagineCup rules weren’t that clear about How and Where to upload the video.

If you want to test the transmission of doctors letters between Medox Desktop and Medox Mobile, we provide you some test files to play with.

Have fun! :)

PS: Please don't get confused with some files called myMD or similiar. This was our "old" name!
